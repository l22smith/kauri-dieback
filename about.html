        <h2>What is Kauri Dieback?</h2>
        <p>Kauri Dieback is a devastating disease caused by a microscopic fungus-like organism called Phytophthora agathidicida. It affects the roots of kauri trees, leading to rotting of the root system and eventual death of the tree. The disease spreads through soil movement and can be transmitted by human activities.</p>
